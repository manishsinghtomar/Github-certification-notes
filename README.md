## Git Hidden Folder

There id a hidden folder called `.git` which tells you that our project is a git repo.

If we wanted to create a git repo in a new project we create the folder and the initalize that repo using `git init`

```
mkdir /workspaces/tmp/new-project
cd /workspaces/tmp/new-project
git init
touch Readme.md
open Readme.md
# makes changes to readme.md
git commit -a -m "add readme file" 
```



## Cloning

We can clone three ways: HTTPS, SSH, Github CLI

Since we are using Github Codespaces we'll a create temporary directory in our workspace

```sh
mkdir /workspace/tmp
cd /workspace/tmp
```

### HTPPS

```md
git clone https://github.com/Pradeep-Pandey13/CheatSheets-HTML-CSS-JavaScript.git
